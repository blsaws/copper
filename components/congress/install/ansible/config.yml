# What this is: An Ansible installer answer file for installing OpenStack Congress on Centos 7.
# Status: testing in progress
#

# temp directory used to build congress dependencies 
tempDir: /tmp

# directory where the binary venv package will be built
virtualPackageDir: /var/tmp

# package version
congressVersion: "2015.1.0"

# directory where to install congress. This should only be the base directory and not the full path. We will create the congress folder automatically
installDir: /opt

# If this is the first time you are installing then set init = True. For subsequent install or upgrades set init = False
# You can also use the --start-at-task="(name)" and --step options to re-run and skip non-idempotent steps
# (non-idempotent means the step will fail if already completed)
init: "True"

# This section contains the answers for all "init" (initial install) steps to 
# initialize congress services, keystone endpoint, congress user creation and database initialization.
